Jackrabbit Finance's cross-chain swaps are powered by the Swing API.

With Swing, you can:
- Launch dApps with cross-chain liquidity and interoperability at its core: Ethereum, EVM's(ie. Polygon, BNB Chain, Avalanche, Fantom), L2's, Solana (full list)
- Execute the best multi-chain routes across major cross-chain bridges, blockchains, and exchanges
- Use the Swing SDK and enable easy access to the Swing API for custom UI buildouts
- Keep users on your interface for on-chain and cross-chain swaps
- Dig into our API or SDK documentation to get started. Swing serves as an open standard and common building block for developers and traders needing cross-chain exchange functionality. We aggregate decentralized liquidity from major blockchains, cross-chain bridges, and decentralized liquidity sources.
